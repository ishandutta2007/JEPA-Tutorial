A comprehensive, hands-on tutorial exploring the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) family of algorithms. This guide is designed for AI researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts who want to understand the principles and applications of this groundbreaking approach to self-supervised learning.

## 🚀 What is JEPA?

The Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is a new paradigm for self-supervised learning, championed by Yann LeCun. Unlike contrastive methods that learn by comparing different views of an image, or generative methods that reconstruct raw pixels, JEPA learns by predicting the representations of different parts of an input in a latent space. This approach encourages the model to learn more semantic and abstract features, leading to highly efficient and powerful representations.

This tutorial will guide you from the foundational concepts of self-supervised learning to the cutting-edge implementations of I-JEPA and V-JEPA.
